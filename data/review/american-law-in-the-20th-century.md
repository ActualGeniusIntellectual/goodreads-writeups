# Review for American Law in the Twentieth Century by Lawrence M. Friedman

My expectations for this book were extremely high. I had read a previous history of law in Europe by Mr. Friedman and thoroughly enjoyed it. I was hoping to feel the same way after reading this book.

However, I did not. Maybe because I am more familiar with politics in the US (I was born in the US), I found his unsolicited political editorializing completely unwarranted. It felt the author was chaffing against the bounds of what would constitute a formal history of the law in America. At some point, he did not seem too interested in writing about law but about conjecturing on the moral culpability of political actors he disliked. There is a time and place for tastefully (he failed on this point as well) communicating one's political palate. Often, his insertions of political commentary felt coerced and unearned.

If I were Mr. Friedman, I would have called this book, "A Political and Contested History of American Law in the Twentieth Century" and done away with the pretense of objectivity and devotion to dispassionate assessment of this domain of American history. It would have saved me the trouble of reading it. I am not interested in Mr. Friedman's pet political projects or ideas. As a non-lawyer, I wanted to know

- the history of law in America,
- what lawyers had been up to,
- what judges do, the nature of courts,
- the smattering of different legal traditions,
- the different legal schools of thought,
- the nature of our legal system.

What I got instead was opinionated and biased history. I am not interested in Mr. Friedman's political opinions. I am interested in the history of law in America.

While the book does indeed achieve its purported purpose of a history, I'm not quite sure it is an unadulterated incantation of the history of law in America. It is a history of law in America as seen through the eyes of Mr. Friedman. It is only through his eyes that this manifestation of history makes sense. The most exasperating aspect is that, should Mr. Friedman have taken up my suggestion of fully embracing his own personal bias along the lines manifesting the tone of his undertaking in the title, I would have nothing to complain about. I would have known what I was getting into. Instead, I was misled into thinking I was getting a history of law in America. What I got was a history of the law and political commentary that poisoned the objectivity of his otherwise formidable and competent analytical distillation of facts.

I have seen this trend of dressing up political commentary and marketing it as neutral enough times for it to be a pet peeve of mine. Mr. Friedman was extremely insistent to make himself known through his historiography. Quite frankly, I don't care about his opinions or his purported charming personality. I wanted a history. If I wanted to know more about Mr. Friedman I would have read "The Charming Intellectual and Personality of one Lawrence M. Friedman." Normalizing the intrusion of personality and opinion and bias under the thin veneer of analysis is getting quite tiresome. Because of the slog this book made me wade through, now I have no interest in reading his later works. He's a fine enough writer and if he could somehow disentangle and extricate the gems of his prose from the muck of his political character, I would be more than happy to read his work. But as it stands, I don't trust him anymore.

I have already read two of his books. The previous one was a history of law in Europe. I enjoyed it immensely and did not notice too many polemics brandished against his perceived enemies. I imagine this is due to lack of imagination on my part and my unfamiliarity in the European scene. But now, I would rather never read a book from this man ever again.

Until he learns to separate and divorce his perspective of the world from reality, something which he coquettishly accuses his perceived enemies of, he will never be a great writer. Quite frankly, I think he should give up on writing history. He obviously can't help himself from foisting and weaponizing historical narratives for personal smug satisfaction. In fact, if he stuck to political commentary, I am sure his reputation would be much better but also more honest. Instead, we get this mediocre tirade-replete exposition of history of law. Very tragic.
